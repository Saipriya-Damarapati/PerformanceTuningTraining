Heap space is divided into 2 major regions called Young region and tenured region or old region.
20-30% is young region and 70-80% is old region.

Young region contains newly created objects
Tenured region contains older objects (objects that have survived some number of GCs)


if number of times gc happens is high, then performance of the application is low.
